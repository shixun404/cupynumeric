        rather the NumPy array that will be produced if the cuPyNumeric array
        is materialized on a single node.

        Attributes
        ----------
        C_CONTIGUOUS (C)
            The data is in a single, C-style contiguous segment.
        F_CONTIGUOUS (F)
            The data is in a single, Fortran-style contiguous segment.
        OWNDATA (O)
            The array owns the memory it uses or borrows it from another
            object.
        WRITEABLE (W)
            The data area can be written to.  Setting this to False locks
            the data, making it read-only.  A view (slice, etc.) inherits
            WRITEABLE from its base array at creation time, but a view of a
            writeable array may be subsequently locked while the base array
            remains writeable. (The opposite is not true, in that a view of a
            locked array may not be made writeable.  However, currently,
            locking a base object does not lock any views that already
            reference it, so under that circumstance it is possible to alter
            the contents of a locked array via a previously created writeable
            view onto it.)  Attempting to change a non-writeable array raises
            a RuntimeError exception.
        ALIGNED (A)
            The data and all elements are aligned appropriately for the
            hardware.
        WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X)
            This array is a copy of some other array. The C-API function
            PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy must be called before deallocating
            to the base array will be updated with the contents of this array.
        FNC
            F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.
        FORC
            F_CONTIGUOUS or C_CONTIGUOUS (one-segment test).
        BEHAVED (B)
            ALIGNED and WRITEABLE.
        CARRAY (CA)
            BEHAVED and C_CONTIGUOUS.
        FARRAY (FA)
            BEHAVED and F_CONTIGUOUS and not C_CONTIGUOUS.

        Notes
        -----
        The `flags` object can be accessed dictionary-like (as in
        ``a.flags['WRITEABLE']``), or by using lowercased attribute names (as
        in ``a.flags.writeable``). Short flag names are only supported in
        dictionary access.

        Only the WRITEBACKIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED flags can be
        changed by the user, via direct assignment to the attribute or
        dictionary entry, or by calling `ndarray.setflags`.

        The array flags cannot be set arbitrarily:
        - WRITEBACKIFCOPY can only be set ``False``.
        - ALIGNED can only be set ``True`` if the data is truly aligned.
        - WRITEABLE can only be set ``True`` if the array owns its own memory
        or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a writeable buffer
        interface or is a string.

        Arrays can be both C-style and Fortran-style contiguous
        simultaneously. This is clear for 1-dimensional arrays, but can also
        be true for higher dimensional arrays.

        Even for contiguous arrays a stride for a given dimension
        ``arr.strides[dim]`` may be *arbitrary* if ``arr.shape[dim] == 1``
        or the array has no elements.
        It does not generally hold that ``self.strides[-1] == self.itemsize``
        for C-style contiguous arrays or ``self.strides[0] == self.itemsize``
        for Fortran-style contiguous arrays is true.

        us how many bytes we have to skip in memory to move to the next
        position along a certain axis.  For example, we have to skip 4 bytes
        (1 value) to move to the next column, but 20 bytes (5 values) to get
        to the same position in the next row.  As such, the strides for the
        array `x` will be ``(20, 4)``.

        Copy of the array, cast to a specified type.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dtype : str or data-type
            Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.

        order : ``{'C', 'F', 'A', 'K'}``, optional
            Controls the memory layout order of the result.
            'C' means C order, 'F' means Fortran order, 'A'
            means 'F' order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous,
            'C' order otherwise, and 'K' means as close to the
            order the array elements appear in memory as possible.
            Default is 'K'.

        casting : ``{'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}``, optional
            Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to 'unsafe'
            for backwards compatibility.

            * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
            * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
            * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
            * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
                like float64 to float32, are allowed.
            * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.

        subok : bool, optional
            If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through (default),
            otherwise the returned array will be forced to be a base-class
            array.

        copy : bool, optional
            By default, astype does not returns a newly allocated array. If
            this is set to True, a copy is made and returned, instead of the
            input array.

        Notes
        -----
        The default value for the ``copy`` argument is the opposite of Numpy.
        Avoiding copies reduces memory pressure.

        Returns
        -------
        arr_t : ndarray
            Unless `copy` is False and the other conditions for returning the
            input array are satisfied (see description for `copy` input
            parameter), `arr_t` is a new array of the same shape as the input

                copied into a standard Python scalar object and returned.
            * int_type: this argument is interpreted as a flat index into
                the array, specifying which element to copy and return.
            * tuple of int_types: functions as does a single int_type
                argument, except that the argument is interpreted as an
                nd-index into the array.

        Returns
        -------
        z : scalar
            A copy of the specified element of the array as a suitable
            Python scalar

        Notes
        -----
        When the data type of `a` is longdouble or clongdouble, item() returns
        a scalar array object because there is no available Python scalar that
        would not lose information. Void arrays return a buffer object for
        item(), unless fields are defined, in which case a tuple is returned.
        `item` is very similar to a[args], except, instead of an array scalar,
        a standard Python scalar is returned. This can be useful for speeding
        up access to elements of the array and doing arithmetic on elements of
        the array using Python's optimized math.

            Notes
            -----
            Compared to indexing syntax, `itemset` provides some speed increase
            for placing a scalar into a particular location in an `ndarray`,
            if you must do this.  However, generally this is discouraged:
            among other problems, it complicates the appearance of the code.
            Also, when using `itemset` (and `item`) inside a loop, be sure
            to assign the methods to a local variable to avoid the attribute
            look-up at each loop iteration.

        Set array flags WRITEABLE, ALIGNED, WRITEBACKIFCOPY,
        respectively.

        These Boolean-valued flags affect how numpy interprets the memory
        area used by `a` (see Notes below). The ALIGNED flag can only
        be set to True if the data is actually aligned according to the type.
        The WRITEBACKIFCOPY and flag can never be set
        to True. The flag WRITEABLE can only be set to True if the array owns
        its own memory, or the ultimate owner of the memory exposes a
        writeable buffer interface, or is a string. (The exception for string
        is made so that unpickling can be done without copying memory.)

        Parameters
        ----------
        write : bool, optional
            Describes whether or not `a` can be written to.
        align : bool, optional
            Describes whether or not `a` is aligned properly for its type.
        uic : bool, optional
            Describes whether or not `a` is a copy of another "base" array.

        Notes
        -----
        Array flags provide information about how the memory area used
        for the array is to be interpreted. There are 7 Boolean flags
        in use, only four of which can be changed by the user:
        WRITEBACKIFCOPY, WRITEABLE, and ALIGNED.

        WRITEABLE (W) the data area can be written to;

        ALIGNED (A) the data and strides are aligned appropriately for the
        hardware (as determined by the compiler);

        WRITEBACKIFCOPY (X) this array is a copy of some other array
        (referenced by .base). When the C-API function
        PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy is called, the base array will be
        updated with the contents of this array.

        All flags can be accessed using the single (upper case) letter as well

            An open file object, or a string containing a filename.
        sep : str
            Separator between array items for text output.
            If "" (empty), a binary file is written, equivalent to

        format : str
            Format string for text file output.
            Each entry in the array is formatted to text by first converting
            it to the closest Python type, and then using "format" % item.

        Notes
        -----
        This is a convenience function for quick storage of array data.
        Information on endianness and precision is lost, so this method is not
        a good choice for files intended to archive data or transport data
        between machines with different endianness. Some of these problems can
        be overcome by outputting the data as text files, at the expense of
        speed and file size.

        When fid is a file object, array contents are directly written to the
        file, bypassing the file object's ``write`` method. As a result,
        tofile cannot be used with files objects supporting compression (e.g.,
        GzipFile) or file-like objects that do not support ``fileno()`` (e.g.,

        For a 1-D array this has no effect, as a transposed vector is simply
        the same vector. To convert a 1-D array into a 2D column vector, an
        additional dimension must be added. `np.atleast2d(a).T` achieves this,
        as does `a[:, np.newaxis]`.

        For a 2-D array, this is a standard matrix transpose.

        For an n-D array, if axes are given, their order indicates how the
        axes are permuted (see Examples). If axes are not provided and
        ``a.shape = (i[0], i[1], ... i[n-2], i[n-1])``, then

            * None or no argument: reverses the order of the axes.
            * tuple of ints: `i` in the `j`-th place in the tuple means `a`'s

        Inform cuPyNumeric that this array will be used in a stencil
        computation in the following code.

        This allows cuPyNumeric to allocate space for the "ghost" elements
        ahead of time, rather than discovering the full extent of accesses
        incrementally, and thus avoid intermediate copies.

        For example, let's say we have a 1-D array A of size 10 and we want to
        partition A across two GPUs. By default, A would be partitioned equally
        and each GPU gets an instance of size 5 (GPU0 gets elements 0-4, and
        GPU1 gets 5-9 inclusive). Suppose we use A in the stencil computation
        `B = A[:9] + A[1:]`. The runtime would now need to adjust the
        partitioning such that GPU0 has elements 0-5 and GPU1 has elements 4-9
        inclusive. Since the original instance on GPU0 does not cover index 5,
        cuPyNumeric needs to allocate a full new instance that covers 0-5,
        leading to an extra copy. In this case, if the code calls
        `A.stencil_hint([1], [1])` to pre-allocate instances that contain the
        extra elements before it uses A, the extra copies can be avoided.

        Parameters
        ----------
        low_offsets: tuple[int]
            Stencil offsets towards the negative direction.
        high_offsets: tuple[int]
            Stencil offsets towards the positive direction.

        Notes
        -----
        This function currently does not behave as expected in the case where
        multiple CPU/OpenMP processors use the same system memory.

        Availability
        --------
